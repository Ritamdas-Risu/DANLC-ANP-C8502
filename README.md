Weather Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes weather data for various states of India for the year 2000. The data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall metrics for 5,000 records across multiple states. The project performs statistical analysis, visualizations, and data validation checks using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Excel.

Dataset
The dataset contains weather data for 20 Indian states over the course of 500 days in the year 2000, including the following parameters:

Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
Rainfall (mm)
Data Source
The dataset was generated for educational purposes, simulating real weather data patterns.
Key Features
Average Temperature per State: Calculates the mean temperature for each state.
Temperature Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of temperatures across all states.
Correlation Analysis: Examines the relationship between temperature and humidity.
Wind Speed Analysis: Finds the days with the highest wind speeds per state.
Rainfall Insights: Identifies the rainiest days in India.
Monthly Humidity Trends: Analyzes the average humidity for each month.
Data Validation: Checks for missing values and outliers (e.g., extreme temperatures or humidity outside valid ranges).
Technologies Used
Python: Used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For handling and processing the data.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
Excel: Used as the data source.
